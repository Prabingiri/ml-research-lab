# Day 1: Infrastructure Setup

## Goals
- Create a research repo with reproducible structure
- Enable GitHub Actions for testing
- Add Dockerfile scaffold
- Plan for Terraform integration later

## Choices
- **IDE**: VSCode (with Jupyter + Copilot)  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (Python 3.10 workflow)  
- **Containerization**: Docker (to run experiments anywhere)  
- **Infra-as-Code (future)**: Terraform (for GCP/AWS deployment)  

## Next Steps
1. Day 2 â†’ first ML experiment (simple model + test)
2. Start building reusable `src/utils/`
3. Plan how weekly reports auto-generate
